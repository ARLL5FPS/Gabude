## Project Setup and Usage

### Important

Since the project requires a MongoDB database, **you must create your own database instance** and update the configuration file accordingly before running the application.

The current configuration does not include a preset or local MongoDB database, so running the project without adjusting the database connection will result in errors.

### Steps to run the project:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Create a MongoDB database (e.g., using MongoDB Atlas or a local MongoDB server).

3. Update the database connection URI in the configuration file to point to your database.

4. In the project folder, open a terminal and run:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   
5. Access the application by navigating to http://localhost:3000/ in your web browser.

6. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to contact the authors.
